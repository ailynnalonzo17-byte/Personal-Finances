# Gotchas — every trap we hit, so you don't

## Data & schema
- **Inherited templates are stale.** The reference build's original dashboard template
  pointed at a Leases table that no longer existed and at moved field IDs. Always pull the
  *current* schema and remap every field ID before baking. Never trust field names.
- **Formula/lookup fields return odd shapes** (`[2035]` arrays; lookup objects). Normalize.
- **Occupancy math needs exclusions.** Units with status "NA"/placeholders and units whose
  *property* is archived must not count as active, or the rate is wrong (the reference
  base read 100% because its only vacant units sat under an archived property — surface
  that on the page rather than hide it; a task already existed to fix it at the source).
- **Empty source tables make zero-KPIs.** An empty payments table produced a permanent
  "$0 overdue" card and $0 rent history. Remove cards nothing feeds; don't display fake
  confidence.
- **Seed/placeholder rows poison charts.** Filter `/placeholder|seed/i` in the baker; a
  "cleared" month with 0/0 rent should be "no data," not a collapse to zero.
- **Month-to-month leases legitimately have past end dates.** Don't flag them.
- **A 360-item task backlog is not a dashboard list.** Scope to immediate/dated/prioritized.

## Privacy / repo hygiene
- **`data.json` contains tenant names → git-ignore it.** It's regenerated at every build,
  so it never needs to be committed. (The reference build committed one seed by accident
  before catching it; the vault's own rule forbids PII in git.)
- **`personal.json` MUST be tracked**, or the 2-hour redeploy (which uploads the served
  folder from the repo) wipes it. It can mention people from Slack — acceptable in a
  private repo of the student's own notes; say so.
- **`sources.json` (email addresses) lives outside `public/`** so it's never served.
- **Only serve `public/`.** If the repo is also a notes vault, the assets directory scope +
  Access are what keep the notes private.
- **A note-syncing tool that auto-pushes (Obsidian git) will deploy a half-finished
  `index.html` sitting modified on disk.** Never leave a draft uncommitted in that repo;
  `git checkout -- <file>` to revert drafts you aren't shipping.
- Pushing a `.github/workflows/*.yml` needs a token with the `workflow` scope; the sync
  tool's token usually lacks it — push workflows yourself with `gh`.

## Cloudflare

### ⛔ A CLOUD session cannot reach Cloudflare at all (09-12-2026, proven with a control)

Cloudflare's API and every `pages.dev` / `workers.dev` address return 403 at the cloud
environment's network proxy. A student's session proved it properly: her own live `gmail-mcp`
Worker failed identically from there. **This is environment, not configuration, and no amount of
retrying or re-authorizing fixes it.**

Phase P and Phase 3 are LOCAL-session-only for this reason, plus the browser driving. If a cloud
session is asked to do either, say so in the first line and stop, rather than building something
else and discovering it at the end. A cloud session CAN still write files and push to the repo;
what it cannot do is deploy or configure Cloudflare.

- **Workers & Pages is not in the left menu on a fresh account.** A student following "click Workers
  & Pages in the menu" gets stuck at step one. Use the search box at the top of the dashboard: type
  Workers, choose Workers & Pages. (Stephanie, 09-09-2026, from a real screen.)
- New accounts get the **Workers** flow, not classic Pages. No output-directory field; use
  a root `wrangler.jsonc` with `assets.directory` and `npx wrangler deploy`.
- **No deploy hooks, no cron triggers** on a static-asset Worker. Refresh via a GitHub
  Action that bakes and `wrangler deploy`s directly.
- **Build watch path defaults to `*`** → every note push rebuilds → burns free minutes.
  Narrow to `command-center/*`.
- **Zero Trust (for Access) requires a card on file even on the Free plan**, plus Terms
  acceptance — the student's screen. Free limits cover a personal login gate; say so
  honestly. Fallback if they refuse a card: Basic Auth coded into the Worker.
- **"Variables cannot be added to a Worker that only has static assets"** refers to
  *runtime* vars. Build-time vars/secrets are under Settings → Builds and work.
- Deploy log streaming sometimes stalls — reload the page.
- Field quirks: first typed character dropped in some fields (prepend a throwaway char,
  then verify); ⌘A doesn't select-all (End + Backspace); right-rail anchors don't scroll.
- The API-token form's **Account Resources is empty by default** — set it to the student's
  account; set Zone Resources to All zones; the summary must list Workers Scripts:Edit.

## GitHub

### ⛔ "Cannot find module '/opt/buildhome/repo/command-center/bake.mjs'" means THE REPO DOES NOT HAVE IT (09-12-2026, from a real student)

Cloudflare clones the repo and runs the build command against what it finds. This error is not a
Node problem, a path problem or a Cloudflare problem. **It is the repo telling you the push never
landed.** Open github.com, look in the repo for `command-center/`, and believe your eyes.

The student who hit this had been told twice — by a session's own summary and by a human helping
her — that "the code is already on GitHub." Neither had opened GitHub. It was not there, because
every local session on her Mac had been unable to push for days, and one commit had already been
lost entirely when its folder was deleted. Days went into deploying a page that did not exist.

**So before ANY Cloudflare import or deploy, and before telling anyone else the code is ready:
read the remote.** `git ls-remote`, or just open the repo in a browser and look. The build log is
a terrible place to discover this and it is where it always gets discovered.

### ⛔ Prove you can push BEFORE you build anything (same incident)

A local session that cannot authenticate to GitHub can still clone, edit, run tests and commit. It
looks completely healthy right up to the push. **Run `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 git push --dry-run` (or
make one trivial commit and push it) as the FIRST thing in any session whose output has to reach the
repo.** If it fails, say so in the first line and stop; do not build for an hour and report the
work stranded at the end.

The student-facing fix is GitHub Desktop: install it, sign in there, and every local session
inherits working credentials. No token goes through a chat. It is hers to do and it takes minutes.

### ⛔ Several clones of the same vault is its own failure (same incident)

That Mac had `~/Projects/Cheryls-Second-Brain` (later deleted, taking a commit with it), a `- Old`
folder that was an empty git shell, and an `- old 2` folder stopping at an earlier commit. Different
sessions ran in different folders and each had a different, confident view of the truth.

**Say which folder you are in, in your first line, and if there is more than one candidate clone,
name them all and ask which is real rather than picking.** Never assume the folder you landed in is
the one the last session used.

- **404 on a private repo's settings = not signed in** in that browser. Open the link in
  the logged-in browser.
- `gh workflow run` + `gh run watch --exit-status` proves the Action end to end. A "Node
  20 is deprecated" annotation is harmless.

## The morning routine
- **The briefing is a scheduled CLOUD routine, and this file said the opposite twice.** One
  version claimed a cloud agent "cannot reach connectors" (false: with connectors attached it
  reads Calendar, Slack, Gmail, Airtable and pushes to the attached repo, proven five mornings
  running on the reference build) and moved the briefing into a Daily Routines row. Stephanie
  reversed that 09-08-2026: a row runs only when the student opens Claude, so the briefing would
  lose currentness for nothing. Cloud is the default; a routines row is only for a source that is
  local to their machine. **Attach every connector to the routine's `mcp_connections`**, including
  ones they connect later — a connector on claude.ai that is not attached is invisible to the run.
- **"We have the credentials" ≠ "the run has them."** Anything running outside the student's
  own session (the GitHub Action that bakes `data.json`) needs its tokens as build secrets.
  A credential on their machine or in a connector is invisible to it.
- **A prompt that hard-codes priorities goes stale.** The first real run led with a
  dormant course because the pasted spec was old; the vault was actually up to date.
  Weight by the student's living priorities note.
- **Old "beta/PostHog"-style references** survive in inherited specs; strip retired tools.
- **Success ≠ work.** A prior routine reported SUCCEEDED daily while doing nothing (its
  environment lacked the tool it needed). Read run logs; watch for the actual commit.
- **The `data.json` GitHub Action cron is UTC**; local-time schedules drift an hour at DST.
- **There is no hand-seeded briefing** (dropped 09-08-2026). The first real briefing is generated
  at the end of the build. If you find yourself writing sample content into `personal.json`,
  stop and run the routine prompt instead.
- The routine reached "pending" Slack workspaces anyway on the reference build because
  their channels currently lived inside the connected workspace. Not a bug — but the map
  should be cleaned up so each workspace truly holds one company.

## Accounting (optional QuickBooks source)
- **Check the books before building the panel.** A QBO report shows POSTED transactions only.
  The reference build's P&L read $0 rental income for three straight months while the
  portfolio sat at 100% occupancy — four months of deposits had never been categorized, so
  they were invisible to every report. Run the P&L, eyeball recent months, and if there's a
  gap say so and stop. Never render the zero as if it were the business.
- **The connector's computed totals are WRONG.** `totalExpenses` came back `0` against ~$170k
  of real expenses; per-month `totalIncome` said `582.49` for a month with $33k of rent. The
  balance sheet and the P&L reported different net income for the same period. Read the named
  rows — `incomeAccountsAggregated["Income"]`, `cogsAccountsAggregated["Cost of Goods Sold"]`,
  `expenseAccountsAggregated["Expenses"]` — and **never sum the maps**, which mix parent rows,
  "Total for X" subtotals and detail rows into one object.
- **The connector can't see the "For Review" queue.** There is no tool for it. If income looks
  missing, that check happens on QBO's Banking screen, by the student.
- **The connector may demand an `industry` on the QBO profile first.** Setting it writes to
  their account — ask first, and pick the accurate NAICS rather than the closest of the three
  it suggests (they're often all wrong).
- **Don't send a student to the Intuit REST API.** Better data, but it needs a developer app
  and a compliance questionnaire Intuit reviews over days, even for a private single-company
  integration. Full reasoning in `quickbooks.md`.

## Process
- **Don't build the whole thing in one go.** Map one source at a time (Gmail → Slack →
  Calendar), confirm, record, move on. It's slower per step and faster overall.
- **The student's mental model will be wrong in specific, predictable ways** (Artifact vs
  hosted refresh; seed vs real; "we have the creds"). Correct them plainly, with a table.
- **Show, don't tell.** Local preview → deploy → verify gate from an unauthenticated
  browser → test-run → read the commit. Each step produced a screenshot or log we showed.
- **Never claim it works.** Verified working means: page renders, gate redirects strangers
  to sign-in, Action run green, routine commit landed and content reads right.
