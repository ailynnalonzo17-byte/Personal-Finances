name: prompt-writer
description: Turn a rough request into an engineered, role-based prompt, then RUN it straight away (or show it for approval first, whichever the owner prefers), so the owner gets a far better answer for one extra sentence. Can also hand the prompt back to copy into another LLM. Triggers on the slash command "/prompt" and on phrases like "use the prompt writer", "prompt writer:", "write a prompt", "write me a prompt for...", "i need a prompt", "I need a prompt for...", "make this prompt better", "improve my prompt", "engineer a prompt that...", "help me prompt Claude to...", "generate/build/draft/craft a prompt...". Do NOT trigger when the owner just asks for a task with no mention of a prompt (do the task), when "prompt" appears in a non-LLM context (login prompt, command prompt, modal prompt), when the owner wants existing non-prompt copy rewritten, or when asking a conceptual question about prompt engineering.

# Prompt Writer

**Version: 1.1 - 10-07-2026** (renamed from prompt-architect; now RUNS the prompt it writes, or shows it for approval first, per the owner's preference; new trigger phrases "write a prompt", "i need a prompt", "use the prompt writer", "improve my prompt")

## Overview

This skill converts vague user requests into production-ready, role-based prompts that pull the best possible output from Claude or any capable LLM. Every generated prompt opens with a precise role assignment, includes the context and constraints the model needs, and is shown in a single code block, then run on the spot (or held for the owner's approval, or handed back to copy elsewhere). Built for operators who use LLMs daily across marketing, technical work, strategy, hiring, and operations and need the prompt to do the heavy lifting the first time.

## When to Use

Fire this skill when the owner wants their request turned into a strong prompt. By default the skill then RUNS that prompt for them in this same chat. It can also hand the prompt back to copy into ChatGPT, Gemini, or another LLM if they ask for that.

The usual way an owner uses it is to put the trigger in front of a rough request:
"Use the prompt writer: draft a renewal email for a tenant whose rent is going up."

Trigger examples:
- `/prompt`
- "Use the prompt writer: [their request]"
- "Write a prompt for..." / "I need a prompt for..."
- "Make this prompt better: [their prompt]"
- "Write me a prompt for generating weekly content ideas"
- "Engineer a prompt that audits my Airtable base structure"
- "Help me prompt Claude to draft listing descriptions"
- "I need a prompt for screening VA candidates"
- "Generate a prompt to turn my transcripts into captions"
- "Build a prompt that outputs a sales call scorecard"
- "Craft a prompt for weekly financial reviews"

## When NOT to Use

Do not fire when:
- The owner asks for a task with no mention of a prompt or the prompt writer. "Write me a blog post about X" means write the post.
- "Prompt" appears in passing in a non-LLM context. "The login prompt isn't firing" or "at the command prompt, type..." is not a prompt request.
- The user wants existing copy, an SOP, or a document rewritten or improved (and it is not itself a prompt).
- The user is asking a conceptual question about prompt engineering. "What makes a good prompt structure?" deserves a direct answer, not a generated prompt.

When in doubt, confirm once: "Want me to build a proper prompt for this first, or just do it?"

## Workflow

1. **Confirm intent** if it is ambiguous whether the user wants a prompt generated or the task done directly. Ask once, then proceed.

2. **Ask 2 to 4 clarifying questions** using the question bank below. Use the tappable question tool when the environment has one. Free-text only as a fallback. Target the highest-leverage unknowns first: audience, tone, output format, constraints, success criteria, scope.

3. **Engineer the prompt** using the six framework rules. Build on what the user said. Do not just repeat it back in fancier language.

4. **Self-audit** against the seven quality criteria before returning.

5. **Run it, or show it first, per the owner's preference.**
   - **Check the preference.** Look in your memory for the owner's prompt-writer preference. If there is none yet, ask once: "When I write you a prompt, should I run it straight away, or show it to you first so you can approve or tweak it?" Save the answer to memory and do not ask again.
   - **"Run it" (the default if they shrug):** show the finished prompt in a single code block so they can see what improved, then immediately carry it out yourself in this chat as your instructions. Fill every [BRACKET] you can from their answers and what you already know about their business; drop the prompt's "ask me clarifying questions" line, because you already asked. If a bracket genuinely needs material only they have (a transcript, a document), ask for that one thing, then run.
   - **"Show me first":** show the prompt in a single code block and stop with one line: "Say go and I'll run it, or tell me what to change." Run it only on their yes.
   - **"Copy it elsewhere":** if they say they want it for ChatGPT or another tool, return the prompt in a code block with one line on where to paste their material, and do not run it.
   - **They can switch any time** by saying "just run it" or "show me the prompt first". Update the saved preference when they do.
   - **Every normal rule still applies when you run it.** Anything that sends, posts, charges, or changes a record still waits for the owner's yes exactly as it would if they had asked you directly. A better prompt is never permission.

## Framework Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Assign a specific role
Every prompt opens with "Act as [role]" where the role is chosen with precision.

Not: "Act as a writer."
Yes: "Act as a senior direct-response copywriter specializing in high-ticket B2B SaaS launches with 10-plus years writing for bootstrapped founders."

Not: "Act as a consultant."
Yes: "Act as a revenue operations consultant with direct experience scaling bootstrapped SaaS from zero to one million in ARR without a sales team."

### 2. Always ask 2 to 4 clarifying questions before drafting
Never skip this step, even when the request seems clear. Use the question bank below. When possible, ask via tappable buttons instead of free-text.

### 3. Build on the request, never just repeat it
The engineered prompt must add context, constraints, role precision, and specificity the user did not mention but a strong output requires. If the generated prompt only restates the request, it has failed.

### 4. Use square brackets for every swappable variable
Role specifics, audience, tone, length, format, industry, deliverable type, constraints, examples. Anything the user might want to change later goes in [BRACKETS]. Future reuse should be simple find-and-replace.

### 5. Engineer for output quality
Every generated prompt must explicitly include:
- Role
- Context the model needs to do the job
- Constraints and boundaries
- Desired output format
- Quality criteria or success definition
- Examples or references when they would help

### 6. Show the prompt inside a single code block
One or two sentences of framing before or after the block. No long explanations. No breakdown of your reasoning. Then run it or wait, per workflow step 5.

## Clarifying Question Bank

Pull the 2 to 4 highest-leverage questions from the relevant category. Present as tappable options whenever possible.

### Content and Copywriting
- Who is the reader and what do they already believe or know about this topic?
- What is the single action you want them to take after reading?
- Platform and length: Instagram caption, email, LinkedIn post, blog, landing page, ad?
- What tone: punchy and direct, warm and story-driven, authoritative and technical, playful?
- Any existing copy or voice reference the output should match?

### Code and Technical
- Language, framework, and runtime environment?
- What does the input look like and what should the output look like?
- Constraints: performance, dependencies, style guide, compatibility?
- New build, bug fix, or refactor of existing code?
- Output scope: code only, code plus tests, code plus inline explanation, code plus docs?

### Strategy and Business
- What decision is this prompt supposed to help you make?
- Time horizon: this week, this quarter, this year?
- Constraints: budget, team size, runway, existing stack, capacity?
- What data or context will you paste in when you run it?
- Do you want options and tradeoffs, or a single recommendation?

### SOPs and Operations
- Who is executing this process: owner, VA, contractor, automation?
- How often does it run: one-off, weekly, every ticket?
- What tools are involved and in what order?
- What triggers the start and what defines done?
- What edge cases or exceptions need to be handled?

### Hiring and Recruiting
- Role and seniority level?
- Stage: resume screen, first call, deep interview, paid test, reference check?
- Non-negotiable skills versus nice-to-haves?
- What does success look like in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?
- What work-style or personality fit matters for this role?

### Sales and Marketing
- Offer, price point, and stage of funnel?
- Avatar: job title, pain point, current alternative, level of awareness?
- Primary objection you need to handle?
- Call to action and landing destination?
- Persuasive, educational, or a hybrid?

## Output Format Spec

Return the finished prompt exactly like this:

One to two sentence framing explaining how to use it.

```
Act as [specific role with specialty and experience marker].

Context:
[What the model needs to know to do this job well. Include audience, situation, stakes, anything that would change the answer.]

Your task:
[Clear statement of the deliverable in one or two sentences.]

Inputs you will work with:
- [Input 1, e.g., pasted transcript]
- [Input 2, e.g., attached file]

Constraints:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]
- [Constraint 3]

Output format:
[Exact structure the model should return. Headers, sections, bullet rules, length, etc.]

Quality criteria:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

Before you start, ask me [N] clarifying questions if any key detail is missing.

Here is the material to work with:
[PASTE INPUT]
```

One line after the block if needed (e.g., "Paste your transcript where indicated.") Nothing more.

## Full Worked Example

**User request:** "Write me a prompt for screening sales hires."

**Claude asks (via tappable buttons):**

1. What sales role are you screening for?
   - SDR (outbound prospecting)
   - Account Executive (full cycle close)
   - Founder-led or hybrid seller
   - Sales ops or RevOps

2. Where in the funnel is this prompt running?
   - First screen (resume plus 15-minute call notes)
   - Deep interview (60-minute conversation)
   - Paid test project scoring

3. What is the candidate actually selling?
   - High-ticket SaaS (over $10k ACV)
   - Low-ticket SaaS or digital product
   - Services or consulting
   - Physical product

4. What output do you want?
   - Scorecard with numeric ratings
   - Written assessment paragraph
   - Red flag and green flag bullets
   - All three

**User answers:** AE full cycle, deep interview, high-ticket SaaS, all three.

**Final prompt returned:**

Copy this into Claude, paste your interview transcript where indicated, and run it.

```
Act as a senior sales hiring manager with 10-plus years building full-cycle Account Executive teams at bootstrapped B2B SaaS companies with ACVs above $10,000.

Context:
You are screening a candidate for an Account Executive role that owns the full cycle from qualified opportunity to closed won. The candidate will sell a high-ticket SaaS product ($[ACV]) to [ICP: job title and company size]. The founder is still closing deals today and needs this hire to take over founder-led selling within [TIMEFRAME]. Pedigree matters less than evidence of self-sourced pipeline and closed revenue in a comparable motion.

Your task:
Review the 60-minute interview transcript or structured notes I paste below and produce a hiring assessment.

Inputs you will work with:
- Full interview transcript or structured notes
- Candidate resume or LinkedIn summary if provided
- Any written responses to take-home questions

Constraints:
- Score only what you see evidence for. If a dimension was not tested, mark it "not assessed" and suggest one follow-up question.
- Do not invent qualifications. Quote the candidate directly when citing strengths or concerns.
- Weight self-sourced closed revenue higher than company logos on the resume.
- No hedging. If the candidate is a pass, say pass.

Output format:

SCORECARD (1 to 5, one-sentence justification each):
- Discovery skill
- Objection handling
- Commercial instinct and pricing confidence
- Pipeline generation and self-sourcing
- Coachability and self-awareness
- Written and verbal clarity
- Fit with early-stage ambiguity

GREEN FLAGS:
[Bulleted, specific, quote the candidate where possible]

RED FLAGS:
[Bulleted, specific, quote the candidate where possible]

WRITTEN ASSESSMENT:
[One paragraph, 4 to 6 sentences, plain-English summary of the candidate.]

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP:
One of: advance to paid test, advance to founder final, pass, request more info. Include a one-sentence rationale.

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (3 to 5):
Specific questions to close gaps before a final decision.

Quality criteria:
- Every rating is backed by specific evidence, not vibes.
- Red flags are stated plainly, not softened.
- The recommended next step is unambiguous.
- The full output is readable in under 3 minutes.

Before you start, ask me 2 clarifying questions if any key detail about the role, ICP, or ACV is missing.

Here is the interview material:
[PASTE TRANSCRIPT OR NOTES]
```

Paste your transcript where indicated and Claude will return the assessment.

## Self-Check Quality Criteria

Before returning the prompt, audit it against these seven criteria. If any fail, rewrite before sending.

1. **Role is specific.** Not "act as a writer" but "act as a [specialty] [role] with [experience marker]." The role tells the model who to be and at what level.

2. **Every swappable variable is in [brackets].** Future reuse should be a simple find-and-replace. Audience, tone, industry, price point, timeframe, format, length.

3. **Context was added beyond the original request.** The prompt includes constraints, success criteria, or edge-case handling the user did not mention but a strong output requires.

4. **Output format is explicit.** The model knows the exact structure to return: sections, bullet rules, length, order.

5. **Zero em dashes.** Use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses instead.

6. **No AI-generic phrasing.** Cut "delve," "leverage," "robust," "seamless," "unlock," "journey," "comprehensive solution," "navigate the landscape," "in today's fast-paced world," and similar. Write how a real operator talks.

7. **Self-contained.** A stranger could paste this prompt into a fresh chat and get a strong result without needing any follow-up explanation from you.
