# How your second brain is organized

**Version: 1.1 - 2026-08-17**

**This is the standard layout. Vera set it up for you and follows it. It is yours: rename or add
folders whenever you like, and edit this file to match. Vera reads THIS copy, in your repo, not the
course's, so whatever you write here is the rule she follows.**

One idea per file. Plain English. If you would not know where to put something, ask Vera and she
puts it where this file says, or proposes a new place and writes it here.

---

## The folders

| Folder | What goes there | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (a file, at the top) | Your operating notes: who you are, how you like to work, what Vera should always remember. Claude reads it automatically every session. Keep it short. | "I own 6 units in Hartford CT. Always draft, never send. I check messages at 9am." |
| `.claude/skills/` | Your team. One folder per skill: Vera, Tessa, Fiona, Owen and the tool skills. These are your copies, customize them freely. | `.claude/skills/tessa/SKILL.md` |
| `policies/` | Your house rules, one per file. What you always do, so the agents never guess. | `policies/late-fees.md`, `policies/pets.md`, `policies/security-deposits.md` |
| `procedures/` | How you do a recurring job, step by step. The agents follow these when a routine runs. | `procedures/move-in.md`, `procedures/renewal.md` |
| `templates/` | Messages and documents you reuse. The agents fill them in, they never invent wording. | `templates/rent-reminder.md`, `templates/lease-renewal-offer.md` |
| `business/` | Facts about your business that are not records: your profile, your team, your vendors, your attorney. | `business/profile.md`, `business/contacts.md` |
| `decisions/` | Decisions you made and why, dated, so nobody re-argues them later. | `decisions/2026-08-17_no-more-month-to-month.md` |
| `notes/` | Weekly reviews, meeting notes, ideas. The thinking that is not a rule yet. | `notes/2026-08-15_weekly-review.md` |
| `reference/` | Maps and lookups Vera keeps for herself: where your data lives, this layout file. | `reference/your-base.md`, `reference/repo-layout.md` |
| `log.md` (a file, at the top) | The running log. Vera appends a line whenever something worth remembering happened. You never edit it. | |

The course calls this whole repo your **Memory Vault**. Same thing.

If you also use the Second Brain skill (the wiki for your thinking and content), its folders `wiki/`,
`sources/`, `stories/`, `my-content/` live right alongside these. There is only ever one `CLAUDE.md`,
one `log.md` and one `decisions/` folder, shared by both.

Your actual records, properties, tenants, leases, money, live in **Airtable**, not here. This repo
holds how you think and how you work. Airtable holds what is true right now.

## Naming

1. **Lowercase, words joined with hyphens, no spaces:** `late-fees.md`, not `Late Fees.md`.
2. **Everything is `.md`** (plain text). Vera can read and write it, and it never breaks.
3. **Anything that happens on a date starts with the date:** `2026-08-17_topic.md`. Sorts itself.
4. **Folder names are plural nouns:** `policies`, `templates`, `decisions`.
5. **A skill folder is named exactly what the skill is called** in its first line, so
   `.claude/skills/tessa/` holds the skill named `tessa`.
6. **One topic per file.** A file called `misc.md` or `notes.md` inside a folder is a smell: split it.

## Changing it

Rename a folder, add one, or drop one you never use. Then update the table above, or tell Vera "I
moved policies into rules" and she updates it and moves the files. From then on she follows the new
layout. **She never puts the course's default back over your changes.**

## Folders already in this vault before Vera set it up

These were here first and stay as they are:

| Folder | What goes there |
|---|---|
| `artifact/` | The finance dashboard page. |
| `data/` | Raw, processed and seed data (statements, transactions). |
| `reports/` | Generated reports, for example monthly expense workbooks. |
| `scripts/` | Python scripts that categorize transactions and build the workbook, card data and loan schedule. |
